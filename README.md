# WalkSafe
An app that makes university campuses safer

## Introduction

We realized that communicating with RAs on university campuses is a lot harder than it needs to be. We either have to communicate through a group chat which takes out privacy, or call an RA if we need help which requires finding their phone number and then waiting for them to pick up.

WalkSafe is an Android app that allows students to notify nearby RAs if they need assistance with anything. It acts as a secondary emergency app, by using the [SafeTrek API](https://docs.safetrek.io/reference#overview) to notify emergency services if necessary.


## What's Next

We hope to add additional functionality on top of what we have. This would mean possibly creating the iOS equivalent and adding extra functionality.
